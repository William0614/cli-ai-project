# Agent Workspace System Design

## Overview
The Agent Workspace system addresses the inefficiency problem where agents repeat actions and lose track of accumulated knowledge during task execution.

## Core Components

### 1. TaskWorkspace
- **Purpose**: Persistent memory for a single task execution
- **Lifecycle**: Created when task starts, persists until task completion
- **Contents**: Actions taken, observations received, accumulated knowledge

### 2. WorkspaceManager
- **Purpose**: Manages workspace creation, updates, and cleanup
- **Features**: Task identification, workspace persistence, knowledge retrieval

### 3. Enhanced Prompts
- **Purpose**: Include workspace context in agent decision-making
- **Integration**: Workspace state becomes part of prompt context

## Architecture

```
TaskWorkspace
├── task_id: str
├── original_request: str
├── current_goal: str
├── actions_taken: List[Action]
├── observations: List[Observation]
├── accumulated_knowledge: Dict[str, Any]
├── progress_state: str
└── next_steps: List[str]

Action
├── timestamp: datetime
├── tool: str
├── args: Dict
├── thought: str
└── goal: str

Observation
├── timestamp: datetime
├── action_id: str
├── status: str
├── output: Any
└── extracted_info: Dict
```

## Benefits

### Immediate Improvements
1. **No Redundant Actions**: Check workspace before repeating operations
2. **Persistent Knowledge**: Remember what was learned in previous steps
3. **Smarter Planning**: Make decisions based on accumulated progress
4. **Better Goal Tracking**: Maintain focus on overall objective

### Example Scenario Fix
**Before**: Agent lists directory 3 times, forgets file list
**After**: Agent checks workspace, sees file list already available, proceeds to next step

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Workspace
- [ ] Create TaskWorkspace class
- [ ] Implement WorkspaceManager
- [ ] Basic persistence and retrieval

### Phase 2: Integration
- [ ] Modify think_two_phase to use workspace
- [ ] Update prompts to include workspace context
- [ ] Add workspace-aware decision making

### Phase 3: Intelligence
- [ ] Smart action deduplication
- [ ] Progress tracking and planning
- [ ] Knowledge extraction and reuse

### Phase 4: Testing
- [ ] Test with image sorting scenario
- [ ] Measure efficiency improvements
- [ ] Validate knowledge persistence

## Success Metrics
- Reduce redundant actions by >80%
- Improve task completion efficiency
- Maintain task context across multiple steps
- Enable complex multi-step reasoning
